## 1-2 Oblivious Transfer Protocol
In a 1â€“2 oblivious transfer protocol, the sender has two messages m0 and m1, and the receiver has a bit b, and the receiver wishes to receive mb, without the sender learning b, while the sender wants to ensure that the receiver receives only one of the two messages.

## Zero Knowledge Protocol (Discrete log)
A zero-knowledge proof or zero-knowledge protocol is a method by which one party (the prover Peggy) can prove to another party (the verifier Victor) that she knows a value x, without conveying any information apart from the fact that she knows the value x.
